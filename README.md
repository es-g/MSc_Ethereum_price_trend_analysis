# **Machine Learning-based Analysis of Ethereumâ€™s Price Trend**

By: **Yesbol Gabdullin**

Practical implementation of MSc Dissertation submitted in partial fulfilment
of the requirements for the degree of
Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence

### **Aim**
* To investigate short-term predictability of Ethereum cryptocurrency using technical indicators, on-chain metrics and search volume (Google Trends)

### **Objectives**
1. Identify to what extent the price trend of Ethereum cryptocurrency is predictable
2. Identify what features result in highest accuracy
3. Explore if using a diverse set of input features (On-chain metrics and search volume) improve the accuracy of predictions
4. Explore various window (training) and testing sizes in walk-forward sliding window approach to identify the optimal
5. Identify the Machine Learning model that is better suited for Ethereum price trend prediction



# **How to Install (Windows)**

1. Create a virtual environment 

`python -m venv <myvenv>` 

where `<myvenv>` is the name of your virtual environment


2. Activate the virtual environment 

`myvenv\Scripts\Activate`

3. Install the dependencies (Python libraries)

`pip install -r requirements.txt` 


# **How to Use**

1. Get free API key from https://min-api.cryptocompare.com
2. Paste your API key into `config.py` file
3.
